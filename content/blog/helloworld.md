Every good blog needs a good first post, said... somebody, probably. I'm not that person.

I was inspired by [Namish](https://namishh.com)'s website to redesign my own. My old design was… charming, but it lacked any substance to it to make it worth visiting. I figured a blog could solve multiple problems in my life: give my site something interest for people to look at, and give _me_ a space to talk about my interests.

## So what have I been up to?

Well, let’s see. I began my diploma in web development this Monday. It's only a 4-month course, and I was really fortunate to have secured a fee-free placement (which is wonderful news for my wallet). It's a very small class - maybe only 5 or 6 students - but everyone seems friendly enough, and it'll make getting to know everyone really easy. Besides, this is a subject I’d like to think I’m pretty well versed in, so if it all goes well then the course will _fly_ by.

I’ve been trying out Linux again. My last proper experience with Linux was maintaining an Ubuntu Server installation on an unused mini PC, which I used mostly to host Minecraft servers. That was a few years ago, and I’d always been interested in trying Linux again ever since. I got a laptop last year from a relative, so that’s been dual-booting EndeavourOS and Windows 11. I might talk more about my interest in the ricing scene at a later date.

Other than that, it’s been a lot of gaming. Nothing too special.

## What's the plan here?

That's a good question. I wanted a space where I could talk about what I'm up to without thinking too hard about the target audience. With any luck, I'll get to have that here. My website's always been a sort of impermanent platform, constantly changing because I'm unhappy with how it looks. With any luck, maintaining this blog will give me an excuse to conform to a structure.

Think that's all for now. Have a good day :)
